To allow for the grid to rely heavily on renewables, important operational changes must be done. For example, novel approaches for frequency regulation, ie, for balancing in real-time demand and generation, are required to ensure the stability of a renewable electric system. Demand response programs in which loads adjust in part their power consumption for the grid’s benefit, can be used to provide frequency regulation. In this proposal, we present and motivate a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to meet the algorithmic requirements for providing real-time power balancing with demand response.&lt;/p>

We believe this &lt;a href="https://www.ai4climatecoop.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competition&lt;/a> opens the way for beneficial contributions to several different areas in research and policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Researchers and engineers: Whether it be in Economics, Machine Learning, Agent-based Modelling, Game Theory, Political Science, Behavioral Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Complex Systems or any other discipline you believe to be relevant, this competition identifies and creates many opportunities for innovation. For example, negotiation protocols between different regions are one of the keys to the encourage climate mitigation. One of the goal of this competition is to design a negotiation mechanism between different regions so that agents may not only maximize their own utility but also care more about the collective goal — carbon emission mitigation We envision diversity as a strength, not a weakness. Solving problems that affect each and every person calls for transversal thinking, multifaceted contributions and collaboration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Policy writers and makers: Transmuting good research into tangible political results creates long lasting change, and properly communicating outcomes to governments is just as necessary as the research itself. We envision clear communication and actionable, targeted recommendations as a pillar of change and an important skill for anyone looking to make an impact.&lt;/p>
