To overcome these limitations, we introduce Retrospective Social Cost of Carbon Updating (ReSCCU), a novel mechanism that corrects for these limitations as empirically measured evidence is collected. To implement ReSCCU in the context of carbon taxation, we propose Retroactive Carbon Pricing (ReCaP), a market mechanism in which polluters offload the payment of ReSCCU adjustments to insurers. To alleviate systematic risks and minimize government involvement, we introduce the Private ReCaP (PReCaP) prediction market, which could see real-world implementation based on the engagement of a few high net-worth individuals or independent institutions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers and engineers: Whether it be in Economics, Machine Learning, Agent-based Modelling, Game Theory, Political Science, Behavioral Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Complex Systems or any other discipline you believe to be relevant, this competition identifies and creates many opportunities for innovation. For example, negotiation protocols between different regions are one of the keys to the encourage climate mitigation. One of the goal of this competition is to design a negotiation mechanism between different regions so that agents may not only maximize their own utility but also care more about the collective goal â€” carbon emission mitigation We envision diversity as a strength, not a weakness. Solving problems that affect each and every person calls for transversal thinking, multifaceted contributions and collaboration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Policy writers and makers: Transmuting good research into tangible political results creates long lasting change, and properly communicating outcomes to governments is just as necessary as the research itself. We envision clear communication and actionable, targeted recommendations as a pillar of change and an important skill for anyone looking to make an impact.&lt;/p>
