Our project aims to raise awareness and conceptual understanding of climate change by bringing the future closer.  

We will do this by developing an interactive website to depict accurate and personalized outcomes of climate change using cutting-edge techniques from artificial intelligence and climate modeling.  

Bringing together researchers from different areas, we aim to design an educational tool that will produce accurate and vivid renderings of the future outcomes of climate change as they are likely to affect individuals.
